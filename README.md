# challenge-4

## Description

The purpose of this project is to test user's understanding of coding concepts we learned in class. I learned how to utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to create a functioning quiz. I did struggle with this project and would like to use a resubmission for this challenge. I will turn a new one in over the weekend!
