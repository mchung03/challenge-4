# challenge-4

## Description

The purpose of this project is to test user's understanding of coding concepts we learned in class. I learned how to utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to attempt to create a functioning quiz. I did struggle with this project and Web API a lot. I would like to use a resubmission for this challenge. I will turn a new one in over the weekend!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This is the starting page of the quiz when directed to the website.

The timer will start counting down after you press the start button and you will be redirected to the quiz screen.

Once the timer reaches 0 and you don't complete the quiz in time, the website will alert you!

I set the timer at 10 seconds for now so that you can see the popup earlier than waiting 60 seconds (as I have planned the original code to be).
